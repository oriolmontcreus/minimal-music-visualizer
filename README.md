Welcome to the Minimal Music Visualizer project! ðŸŽ‰ This project is a simple, yet powerful, music visualizer built with JavaScript and Three.js. It allows you to visualize your favorite music tracks in a 3D environment with a rotating torus that reacts to the bass frequency of the audio.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **ðŸŽ§ Audio Playback**: Play your favorite tracks directly in the browser.
- **ðŸ”® Dynamic Visualization**: Watch as a 3D torus reacts to the music, changing its scale and opacity based on the bass frequency.
- **ðŸŽ¶ Audio Selection**: Choose from a pre-loaded list of tracks, or drop your own audio file onto the page to add it to the list.
- **ðŸŒˆ Gradient Visuals**: Enjoy a radial gradient from blue to dark blue applied to the torus for a soothing visual experience.
